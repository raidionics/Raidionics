Software to automatically segment brain tumors from pre-operative MRI scans, compute their characteristics (e.g., volume, location), and generate a standardized report.
The software was introduced in the article "Brain tumor preoperative surgery imaging: models and software solutions for
segmentation and standardized reporting", which has been published in [Frontiers in Neurology](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.932219/full).
