Software to automatically segment brain tumors from pre-operative MRI scans, compute their characteristics (e.g., volume, location), and generate a standardized report.
The software was introduced in the article [_"Brain tumor preoperative surgery imaging: models and software solutions for
segmentation and standardized reporting"_](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.932219/full), which was published in Frontiers in Neurology. The article is open access.
Version 1.0 corresponds to the software as it was when the article was submitted.
